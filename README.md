Markdown and RST files of the articles on [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com). They are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International. You can see the [License](LICENSE.md) for more information. 

The articles were originally written as restructured text and published as a static website [using Pelican](https://github.com/PFTL/website). In 2020 the website was migrated to a [Wagtail-Django based option](https://github.com/PFTL/django_website). I migrated the rst files to markdown, both are available. 

Starting January 2020, the files will be written only in Markdown. If you have any improvements for an article, I encourage you to submit a pull request, or open an issue mentioning what you found which can be improved.
