title: What are Hashable Objects
---

To understand hashable objects in Python, it is important to review what
a hash table is. Following [the article on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), a hash table is a
data structure that can map keys to values and that implements a hash
function to compute the index to an array of buckets or slots. Heavy
words, I know.

The idea behind a hash table is that, in the end, you can reduce a
complex object to an index in an array. The analogy with a mail
directory may be appropriate. Imagine you have a collection of names of
people and their addresses. You store each address as soon as you meet a
new person, one under the other. A hash table in such case will be
responsible for transforming a name to a number that corresponds to the
row in which their information is written.

If you have enough experience with Python, the first thing that probably
came to mind is a dictionary. That would be the easiest way of storing
addresses for people that you meet. You can easily retrieve their
information by looking up their names. Even if dictionaries are a
general concept in which keys are associated to values, Python, in fact,
implements a hash table by default (which doesn't mean this cannot
change in the future without affecting how dictionaries work).

One of the complications of hash tables is how to implement the hash
function in a reliable way. Immutable data types in Python come with a
built-in method for computing their hash value, which is called
`__hash__`. Let's see for example what happens with strings or tuples:

```pycon
>>> a = '123'
>>> a.__hash__()
4031090051524460767
>>> b = (1, 2, 3)
>>> b.__hash__()
2528502973977326415
```

You see that strings and lists are reduced to integers. If you would use
numbers instead:

```pycon
>>> c = 1
>>> c.__hash__()
1
>>> d = 1.1
>>> d.__hash__()
230584300921369601
```

However, mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries do not have a
hash method. That is one of the reasons why you cannot use that kind of
objects as keys for dictionaries. What is important to note is that for
immutable types, the hash value depends only on the data stored and not
on the identity of the object itself. For instance, you can create two
tuples with the same values, and see the differences:

```pycon
>>> var1 = (1, 2, 3)
>>> var2 = (1, 2, 3)
>>> id(var1)
140697473296656
>>> id(var2)
140697473295216
```

They are indeed different objects, however:

```pycon
>>> var1.__hash__()
2528502973977326415
>>> var2.__hash__()
2528502973977326415
```

This means that if you use them as dictionary keys, they are going to be
indistinguishable from each other, for instance:

```pycon
>>> var3 = {var1:'var1'}
>>> var3[var2]
'var1'
```

In the same way, you could have used the tuple itself:

```pycon
>>> var3[(1, 2, 3)]
'var1'
>>> var3[1, 2, 3]
'var1'
```

Based on what we saw, hashing an object can be thought as converting it
to an integer based on its content, but not on the identity of the
object itself. Of course, this may give problems, because you are
reducing a very large space of possibilities into a finite set of
integers. This reduction may give rise to something known as hash
collisions, i.e., two objects which are reduced to the same integer even
if their values are different.

A very simple example of hash collisions is what happens between a
simple string and an integer:

```pycon
>>> var1 = 'a'
>>> var1.__hash__()
12416037344
>>> var2 = 12416037344
>>> var1.__hash__() == var2.__hash__()
True
```

Both `var1` and `var2` have the same hash value. So, we may wonder, what
happens if we use them in a dictionary, let's try it to find out:

```pycon
>>> var3 = {var1: 'var1'}
>>> var3[var2] = 'var2'
>>> var3
{'a': 'var1', 12416037344: 'var2'}
```

As you can see in the snippet above, Python is relying on more than just
the hash value of an object when using it as keys for a dictionary.

Hash Values of Custom Classes
=============================

We have seen [before](%7Bfilename%7D17_mutable_and_immutable.rst) that
there are differences between mutable and immutable types in Python.
Built-in immutable types have always a hash method, while mutable types
don't. However, this leaves outside custom defined classes. By default,
all instances of custom classes will have a hash value defined at
creation and it will not change over time. Two instances of the same
class will have two different hash values. For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

my_obj = MyClass(1)
print(my_obj.__hash__()) # 8757243744113
my_new_obj = MyClass(1)
print(my_new_obj.__hash__()) # -9223363279611078919
```

If you run the code above, you will see that the hash value that you get
from your objects changes every time. This is because the hash is
derived from the object's id. Python, as expected, allows you to define
your own hash value. For example, you can alter `MyClass` like this:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, var):
        self.var = var

    def __hash__(self):
        return int(self.var)
```

If you re-run the example, you will see that both objects have the same
hash value of 1. So, let's see what happens if we use them as the keys
for a dictionary:

```pycon
>>> my_obj = MyClass(1)
>>> my_obj_2 = MyClass(1)
>>> var = {my_obj: 'my_obj'}
>>> var[my_obj_2] = 'my_obj_2'
>>> print(var)
{My Class: 'my_obj', My Class: 'my_obj_2'}
```

What you can see is that, even if the hash value is the same, they end
up as different keys in the dictionary. There is still something else
missing. Even if their hash values are the same, they are different
objects:

```pycon
>>> my_obj == my_obj_2
False
```

We can tweak the `MyClass` class in order to output `True` when
comparing it:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, var):
        self.var = var

    def __hash__(self):
        return int(self.var)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other.var == self.var
```

The method `__eq__` is used to determine whether one object is equal to
another. Because `MyClass` takes only one argument when instantiating,
we just compare that value. For example, we would get:

```pycon
>>> var1 = MyClass(1)
>>> var2 = MyClass(1)
>>> var3 = MyClass(2)
>>> var1 == var2
True
>>> var1 == var3
False
```

It works as we would expect it to. If we try again with a dictionary:

```pycon
>>> var4 = {var1: 'var1'}
>>> var4[var2] = 'var2'
>>> var4
{My Class: 'var2'}
>>> var4[var3] = 'var3'
>>> var4
{My Class: 'var2', My Class: 'var3'}
```

Finally, we see what is that dictionaries in Python are using for
defining their keys. They do not only look at the hash value, they also
look whether the keys are the same or not. If they are not, they will be
assigned to a new element instead of the same one. You can try and see
what happens if two elements are equal, but have different hash values.

Now you are starting to go through risky waters. If you would compare
your object to something other than the `MyClass` instance (or better
said, any object without a `var` attribute), an exception would be
raised. You can also force the equality to be true regardless of the
object you are comparing it to. So, for example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, var):
        self.var = var

    def __hash__(self):
        return int(self.var)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return True
```

And now, we would find a strange behavior:

```pycon
>>> my_obj = MyClass(1)
>>> var = 1
>>> my_obj == var
True
>>> var2 = {my_obj: 'my_obj'}
>>> var2[var] = 'var'
>>> print(var2)
{MyClass: 'var'}
```

So now you see that dictionaries test two things: the hash value and the
equality, if one of them doesn't match, then it is going to be assigned
as a new key.

Of course, there are many details missing regarding how hash tables
work, but this is a pretty good introduction into how some of the
under-the-hood things work in Python. They may also give you a hint into
why things work or stop working at apparently random places.
