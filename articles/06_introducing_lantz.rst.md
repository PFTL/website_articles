title: How to Write a Driver with Lantz
---

Lantz is a package written by several researchers who wanted to have a
framework to build instrumentation on Python. It is open source and
hosted [on Github](https://github.com/LabPy/lantz). Their description is
very clear:

> Lantz is an automation and instrumentation toolkit with a clean,
> well-designed and consistent interface. It provides a core of commonly
> used functionalities for building applications that communicate with
> scientific instruments allowing rapid application prototyping,
> development and testing. Lantz benefits from Python's extensive
> library flexibility as a glue language to wrap existing drivers and
> DLLs.

Lantz was built with one objective in mind: make easier to researchers
the development of drivers for their devices. With time the Lantz group
has built an entire framework that handles different types of
connections, such as GPIB, Serial, Ethernet, etc. and much more. The
values generated are kept in a cache that prevents unnecessary
communications with the devices. Plus, the syntax is simple and allows
to check for limits and units before sending commands to the real
device.

Let's see step by step how to build a driver for a common device, for
instance, a [Tektronics
Oscilloscope](https://www.tek.com/oscilloscope/tds1000-manual). The
first thing we need to do is to import the needed modules from Lantz.

```python
from lantz.feat import Feat
from lantz.action import Action
from lantz.messagebased import MessageBasedDriver
```

We will see how to use each one of them. We first define the class:

```python
class TDS1012(MessageBasedDriver):

MANUFACTURER_ID = '0x699'
DEFAULTS = {'USB': {'write_termination': '\n',
                        'read_termination': '\n',
                        'timeout': 5000,
                        'encoding': 'ascii'
            }}
```

We inherit from the general `MessageBasedDriver` because the
Oscilloscope communicates through an exchange of text commands. We
define the Manufacturer Id because it is one of the easiest ways of
identifying USB devices. Beware that if there were two different
Tektronix devices connected, the program will not be able to
differentiate between them, you should provide more information as I
will show below.

The second important step is to define the defaults for the
communications. In this case, we are setting the defaults for a USB
communication. The write and read terminations are the new line
character and we set the encoding to ascii; all this information can be
found in the manual. We set the timeout to 5 seconds; if a command takes
longer than that to execute it will stop it.

Now we are ready to start developing some more interesting code for our
driver. Normally, one of the first commands we can exchange with a
device is to ask for its identification. We can achieve it like so:

```python
@Feat()
def idn(self):
   return self.query('*IDN?')
```

Now we see the use of the first decorator, called `Feat`. Decorators in
Python are complex, but they can be described mainly as functions that
take as arguments other functions. When we use the `Feat` decorator a
lot of things are going to happen internally in Lantz, but we shouldn't
worry too much for the time being. What you should remember is that
Features are all those elements in a device that will return a value or
that can be set to a value. The identification of the oscilloscope is
one of such features. Now we can already use the class:

```python
with TDS1012.via_usb() as osc:
   print(os.idn)
```

And now we see the magic of Lantz happening. First, the fact that we can
use the `with` statement means that some methods were defined for us
under the hood; these methods are in charge of initializing and
finalizing the communication with the device, in order to free the
resource right after the statement finishes. The second important thing
to notice is that we initialize the device with the `via_usb()` method.
Of course, it could have been `via_serial()`, for example, but let's
keep with the USB for now.

The second important thing to note is that the method `idn` is treated
as a property of the device itself. This is achieved through the `Feat`
decorator. If you are an experienced Python programmer you probably know
how to achieve this behavior for your own classes; in Lantz, you
shouldn't worry too much about understanding it, but you have to learn
just how to use them.

Now, imagine you want to trigger the device; that doesn't count as a
Feature because you are not setting a specific value nor getting a
value. That is the situation where you would use an `Action` decorator:

```python
@Action()
def trigger(self):
   self.write('*TRG')
```

In this case, we are only writing to the oscilloscope and therefore we
are not awaiting any output value after the action. `Action` decorators
don't have much magic behind; they can be thought as the buttons on a
device; a button is pressed and an action is triggered.

We have so far only discussed a passive `Feat`, or better called, a
*read-only* only feature. But what happens when we have a feature that
actually accepts values; the oscilloscope, for example, can be set to
acquire one of two different channels. First, we define the *feature* to
read which channel is going to be read, in exactly the same way than for
the `idn` feature.

```python
@Feat(limits=(1,2))
def datasource(self):
   return self.query('DAT:SOU?')
```

The first difference to note here is that we have added limits to the
feature, in this case, the value it will output will be in the range
from 1 to 2 (1 and 2 included). While reading from a device it is not
important to know the limits, but when we write, it becomes crucial. The
way of setting the value of the data source is like this:

```python
@datasource.setter
def datasource(self,value):
   self.write('DAT:SOU CH{}'.format(value))
```

Again, if you have ever worked with properties of classes the syntax may
result familiar, but if you haven't don't worry too much. Once we have
defined the method `datasource` as a `Feat`, we can change its value by
defining a `setter`. Now, pay attention here, the decorator we use is
`@datasource.setter`, because the function that comes after is exactly
that, instructions on how to set the `datasource` feature. The method
defined right after is the function that is going to be called when we
do something like:

```python
dev.datasource = 1
print(dev.datasource)
dev.datasource = 2
print(dev.datasource)
dev.datasource = 3 # This will raise an Exception
```

Note that it takes one argument, value. The value will be first checked
against the limits we established in the `Feat` declaration, i.e. it
should be between 1 and 2. That is why if you try to assign the value 3
to it, it will fail. Because of how we did things, if you send the value
1.5 to the datasource, it won't fail, but it is not a valid command.

Using Units
===========

One of the most useful utilities of Lantz is the built-in units. The
oscilloscope doesn't provide a lot of good opportunities to work with
units but trust me when you are working with other devices they are
going to be very handy. When you are reviewing old code it is always
hard to remember if the values should be set in nanometers, centimeters
and sometimes you don't want to dig up the manual from an obscure
website or cupboard in your lab. Let's imagine we have a tunable laser,
and we want to set the output wavelength to it. Our code would become:

```python
@Feat(units='nm', limits=(1480, 1640, 0.0001))
def wavelength(self):
   return self.query('WA')

@wavelength.setter
def wavelength(self, value):
   self.query('WA%.4f' % value)
```

We begin by declaring a feature, with units nanometers and some limits.
Importantly, we set the step at which we can change the wavelength:
0.1pm. Now, the wavelength setter looks exactly the same as with the
oscilloscope. All the magic is going to happen thanks to the `Feat`
decorator at the beginning, converting to the proper units before
actually sending the command to the device. To use it, you can just do:

```python
from lantz import Q_

wl = Q_('1500nm')
dev.wavelength = wl
print(dev.wavelength)
wl = 1510
dev.wavelength = wl
print(dev.wavelength)
um = Q_('um')
wl = 1.520*um
dev.wavelength = wl
print(dev.wavelength)
wrong = Q_('1500V')
dev.wavelength = wrong
```

The first thing we have to do is to import the module Quantity directly
from Lantz, which is basically the unit registry from Pint; if this is
the first time you hear about Pint, I really suggest that you check out
[that project](http://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We then define a
variable `wl` as a 1500nm quantity and set the laser wavelength to it.
The rest of the commands are just to test the different scenarios; for
example, when you don't specify units, Lantz will automatically assume
the default units (the ones you set in the `@Feat`). You can, of course,
use other units; I've chosen micrometers, but anything that is
distance-related would have just worked fine. You could have even used
inches. Of course, the program will raise an Exception if you try to
pass the wrong units to the wavelength.

The advantage of using units so early in the code (at driver
development) is that it will make it clear for the rest of our programs
what units are we supposed to use. We don't need to worry about a user
(or even ourselves) confusing nanometers with micrometers, the
conversion will happen under the hood. In my experience, however, few
people are used to the Pint package and get slightly confused when they
have to work with a new type of variable that has both a number and a
unit. Anyways, a bit of practice doesn't heart.

Conclusions
===========

Lantz has seen a rollercoaster of development cycles, from very active
to almost abandoned. Lately, it has been hibernating, as you can see by
the number of merge requests and issues open that no one has replied to.
In any case, the package works reasonably well, but what is more
important is that you can learn a lot from their ideas. The use of
decorators for communicating with devices, for example, is a great way
of simplifying a lot of actions, like checking the limits and the units.

I try to implement the new drivers that I write in Lantz, but I am also
realistic and know that for some devices it is better not to depend on
it, especially when dealing with very complex systems such as cameras.
