title: Monkey Patching and its consequences
---

Monkey patching is a technique that allows you to alter the behavior of
objects at runtime. Even though it can be a very useful feature, it can
also make your code much harder to understand and debug, and therefore
you have to be careful with how you implement monkey patching. In this
article, we are going to see some examples of how you can use monkey
patching to solve quickly specific problems. We are also going to
discuss the consequences of monkey patching in the context of larger
projects.

Monkey patching is tightly related to the idea of [mutability in
Python](%7Bfilename%7D17_mutable_and_immutable.rst). Custom objects are
mutable, and therefore their attributes can be replaced without creating
a new copy of the object. To quickly recap those ideas, we can do the
following:

```python
class MyClass:
    a = 1
    b = '2'
```

And then we can use the code like this:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
var2 = var1

var1.a = 2
var1.b = '3'

print(var2.a)
# 2
print(var2.b)
# '3'
```

If we go line by line, you see that we create an object using `MyClass`
and we call it `var1`. We then copy the object to another variable,
called `var2`. We change the values stored in `var1`, but we observe
that the values stored in `var2` have also changed. This is simply
because, in Python, the variable is only a label. In the line
`var2 = var1` we have just copied the label, but both are pointing to
the same underlying object.

Python also allows you to change attributes in the class itself, not in
the instance of the class. We can do the following:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
var2 = MyClass()
print(var1.a)
# 1
MyClass.a = 2
print(var1.a)
# 2
print(var2.a)
# 2
```

What we see is that if we directly alter the value of any of the
attributes of the class, the instances inherit this change. This is both
very useful and very dangerous, since you may be altering the value of
attributes of objects which you were not intending to modify. There is
one last behavior that is important to point out, and refers to mixing
the two approaches we have followed before:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
var2 = var1

var1.a = 2
var1.b = '3'

MyClass.a = 3

print(var1.a)
# 2
print(var2.a)
# 2
```

Even if you change the attribute `a` to `3`, you don't see this change
appearing on the instances of the class. The root cause of this lays in
the ideas behind [mutable and
immutable](%7Bfilename%7D17_mutable_and_immutable.rst) data types in
Python. Since you altered the value of `var1.a`, now the attribute is
pointing to an object different from the object the class attribute
points to. If this last line doesn't make sense, go to the articles
linked earlier on mutable and immutable data types.

Finally, the last case I wanted to point out is what happens if you keep
a reference to the attribute `a` before you modify it:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
var2 = var1

var3 = var1.a
[...]
print(var3)
# 3
```

I have skipped the code in which you change the value of the attributes.
Now you see that if you actually store `var1.a` in the variable `var3`,
this variable is actually modified when you change the value stored
directly in the class. All this behavior actually makes sense, if you
think that variables only store references to objects and not the object
itself and that when you change an immutable variable, you create a new
reference.

All the examples above refer to monkey patching in one way or another.
You can see that we are changing the values of a class during runtime.
We have tried to highlight some of the consequences, expected or not, of
changing the value of an attribute later in the execution of the program
and not in the definition itself.

The examples above can be extended if we consider that methods are
attributes which behave exactly like `a` or `b` in our examples above:

```python
class MyClass:
    a = 1
    b = '2'

    def get_value(self):
        return self.a
```

We instantiate the class:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
print(var1.get_value())
```

And we should see that everything is working as expected. We then define
a new function that we would like to use to replace `get_value`:

```python
def get_new_value(cls):
    return cls.b
```

In the function above, I've replaced `self` by `cls` just to make it
more evident, but you are free to use whatever keyword makes more sense
in your context. And we replace the method:

```python
MyClass.get_value = get_new_value
```

If you use it, you will get:

```python
print(var1.get_value())
# 2
```

You see that we have replaced the `get_value` after the `var1` has been
defined. If we would define a new object, it seems reasonable to expect
that we would get the same output:

```python
var2 = MyClass()
print(var2.get_value())
# 2
```

If we would have defined the two distinct objects before changing the
method, the outcome would have been the same. What you see is that you
can overwrite the method of the class:

```python
var1 = MyClass()
var2 = MyClass()

MyClass.get_value = get_new_value

print(var1.get_value())
print(var2.get_value())
```

The examples at the beginning of the article, when we were using an
integer or a string as attributes are still valid. You can check what
happens if you copy the object, you store it as a new variable, and then
you overwrite the method. There are no mysteries, methods are attributes
such as integers or strings. The main difference is that they take
inputs.

In the example above, we have replaced the method at the class-level. If
we want to replace the method at an instance level, then the approach
would be slightly different. Note that if we do it at a class-level, all
the instances will get the changes, and this may not be what we want. We
can do:

```python
import types

class MyClass:
    a = 1
    b = '2'

    def get_value(self):
        return self.a

def get_new_value(cls):
    return cls.b

var1 = MyClass()
var2 = MyClass()
var1.get_value = types.MethodType(get_new_value, var1)
print(var1.get_value())
# 2
print(var2.get_value())
# 1
```

You see in this example that we have altered the behavior of the method
of `var1` but not of `var2`. Note that we are importing `types` at the
beginning of the script. The rest is the same we have already done, with
one exception when we replace the `get_value` method. Because we are
changing a method of an instance, it needs to be of the proper type. We
can quickly see the following:

```pycon
>>> type(get_new_value)
<class 'function'>
>>> type(MyClass.get_value)
<class 'function'>
>>> type(var1.get_value)
<class 'method'>
```

The main difference between a method and a function is that the first
one receives as first argument the instance itself (the `self`). We have
therefore to transform a function into a method before replacing it on
an instance. Pay attention that this is not the case when you change the
class itself.

Module-level monkey patching
============================

The last pattern that I would like to discuss is monkey-patching at the
module level. So far, the attributes and methods we have used, they all
belonged to a custom class. However, it is not the only possibility.
First, in a file called **module.py** we can add the following:

```python
def print_variable(var):
    print(var)
```

And in a second file called **script.py** we add:

```python
import module

var1 = 1

AE_module.print_variable(var1)
# 1
def print_plus_one(var):
    print(var+1)

AE_module.print_variable = print_plus_one
AE_module.print_variable(var1)
# 2
```

You see that monkey patching works also for modules. When you try to
achieve this kind of patching, you have to be careful with the order in
which importing happens in Python. If you use the **\_\_init\_\_.py**
files to load modules, and there is some dependency between each other,
when you monkey patch, it may be that it is too late for the program.
Similar to what happens when you alter the value of an attribute of an
object and then you change the value at a class-level.

If you remember that Python imports modules only once, then the patching
can take very interesting forms. You can create a new file, called
**module2.py** and add the following:

```python
import module


def another_print(var):
    module.print_variable(var+1)
```

You see that we are using the `print_variable` from the original module.
We are just adding `+1` before printing. We can alter the file
**script.py** to include this new module:

```python
import module
import module2

var1 = 1

module.print_variable(var1)
# 1

def print_plus_one(var):
    print(var+1)

module.print_variable = print_plus_one

module.print_variable(var1)
# 2
module2.another_print(var1)
# 3
```

You see that by changing the `print_variable` on our main script, we
have also altered what is happening on our second module. There are a
lot of things you can start thinking about after seeing these patterns.

When (not) to Monkey Patch
==========================

Monkey patching is very powerful and it shows how flexible Python is. In
the end, everything is derived from the same principles of understanding
different data types and what variables mean in Python. However, it may
be very hard to understand when would you use these patterns in your own
programs.

As a general rule, the best is not to monkey patch. If you want to alter
the behavior of a program, for example, you can define child classes for
the ones you want to alter. The problem with monkey-patching is that the
behavior of a program becomes much harder to understand. In the example
above, when you call `module2.another_print` you are seeing an output
which is very hard to understand. If you check the module, you won't see
why you would get `3` and not `2`. Tracing back where the behavior was
changed is very complicated. If you inspect the variables, you will see
that there is nothing wrong, and `var1` is still `1`.

However, sometimes there can be a great benefit. For example,
calculating Fast Fourier Transforms with numpy can be slower than with
other implementations. Imagine you would like to use PyFFTW, but you
don't want to re-write all your program. You can monkey-patch your code!
See the example below (taken [from the
docs](http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/sphinx/tutorial.html)):

```python
import pyfftw
import numpy

numpy.fft = pyfftw.interfaces.numpy_fft
```

Now, whenever you use the FFT routines provided by numpy, they will be
automatically replaced by those of PyFFTW. This can have a huge impact
on your program, and it only took one line of code! This is a special
example but there are other situations in which you may consider monkey
patching.

A common situation is with testing. Sometimes you want to test your code
in an environment which lacks some functionality, or you want to prevent
that because of the test you actually modify a live database. In that
case, before doing the test you can change the methods that communicate
with a database. If you work in a lab, a very common situation is when
you want to avoid communicating with a device while you are testing your
program.

Exactly how to achieve this behavior will depend on your situation, but
with the examples above you already have a clear picture of what the
strategy could be.
