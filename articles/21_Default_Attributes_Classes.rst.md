title: Mutable and Immutable Attributes of Classes
---

We have seen how to leverage the differences between [mutable and
immutable objects](%7Bfilename%7D17_mutable_and_immutable.rst) and what
happens when you use mutable types as default function arguments.
However, we haven't discussed what happens when you use mutable types as
default attributes of classes.

Default values for attributes can be defined in different ways in your
classes. Let's start by looking at what happens if you define them in
the `__init__` method. Let's start with a simple class that takes one
list as the argument when instantiating:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, var=[]):
        self.var = var

    def append(self, value):
        self.var.append(value)

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.var)
```

This is a very simple example that already will show a very peculiar
behavior. The `__init__` takes one list as the argument, and if it is
not provided it will use an empty list as default. We have also added a
method for appending values to the list. The `__str__` method was
defined for convenience to explore the contents of the `var` attribute.
We can instantiate the class and use it as always:

```python
my_class = MyClass()
print(my_class)
# []
my_class.append(1)
print(my_class)
# [1]
```

So far so good, but let's see what happens when we instantiate the
second class:

```python
my_class_2 = MyClass()
print(my_class_2)
# [1]
```

The second time you instantiate a class, it will use a different default
value! It is actually using the updated value from the first instance.
Moreover, if you change the value of the second instance, the value of
the first instance will also change:

```python
my_class_2.append(2)
print(my_class)
# [1, 2]
```

Whatever changes you do to the attribute `var` of one of the objects,
will be reflected into the other. Both attributes are actually the same
object, as you can verify by looking at their ids:

```python
print(id(my_class.var))
# 140228152031752
print(id(my_class_2.var))
# 140228152031752
```

But the two instances are different

```python
print(id(my_class))
# 140228175513360
print(id(my_class_2))
# 140228175513304
```

The same pattern that appeared while using mutable variables as defaults
with functions will appear when using mutable default arguments of
methods in custom classes. If you want to avoid this from happening, you
can always check what [we have done when working with
functions](%7Bfilename%7D17_mutable_and_immutable.rst).

Of course, the same pattern will appear if you use a mutable variable
defined outside of the class, for example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_class = MyClass(my_list)
my_class.append(4)
print(my_list)
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Classes provide another pattern which is the use of **class attributes**
instead of **instance attributes**. Class attributes are those values
that are defined directly in the class, outside of any methods. Let's
update our example to use a class attribute called `var`:

```python
class MyClass:
    var = []

    def append(self, value):
        self.var.append(value)

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.var)
```

And we use it as before:

```python
my_class = MyClass()
my_class.append(1)
print(my_class)
# [1]
```

If we instantiate the class again, we will have the same as before:

```python
my_class_2 = MyClass()
print(my_class_2)
# [1]
```

The main difference with what we have done before is that we can address
directly the `var` attribute of the class:

```python
MyClass.var.append(2)
print(my_class)
# [1, 2]
print(my_class_2)
# [1, 2]
```

You can also address the attribute of an instance directly, without the
need of the `append` method:

```python
my_class_2.var += [3]
print(my_class)
# [1, 2, 3]
print(my_class_2)
# [1, 2, 3]
```

You can see in the examples above, is that the changes you apply to one
of the attributes will be reflected in the attributes of all the other
instances and even in the class itself. There is a big difference,
however, between class attributes and default inputs in methods. Class
attributes are shared between instances by default even if they are
immutable. Let's see, for example, what happens if we use a `var` that
is an integer, and therefore immutable:

```python
class MyClass:
    var = 1

    def increase(self):
        self.var += 1

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.var)
```

Just as we have done before, we will instantiate twice the class and see
what happens:

```python
my_class = MyClass()
print(my_class)
# 1
my_class_2 = MyClass()
print(my_class_2)
# 1
my_class.increase()
print(my_class)
# 2
print(my_class_2)
# 1
```

What you see here is already a big difference. Both instances of
`MyClass` have the same attribute `var`. However, when you increase the
value in one of the instances this change is not propagated to the other
instance nor to new instances of the class.

This is very different from what you would see if you change the value
of `var` in the class itself:

```python
my_class = MyClass()
my_class_2 = MyClass()
MyClass.var += 1
print(my_class)
# 2
print(my_class_2)
# 2
```

You see that class attributes are still linked to the instances. It is
very interesting to see the id of the `var` attribute before and after
changing its value:

```python
my_class = MyClass()
my_class_2 = MyClass()
print(id(my_class_2.var))
# 10935488
print(id(my_class.var))
# 10935488
print(id(MyClass.var))
# 10935488
MyClass.var += 1
print(id(my_class_2.var))
# 10935520
print(id(my_class.var))
# 10935520
print(id(MyClass.var))
# 10935520
```

You see that all the attributes are the same object. When the value is
replaced, since integers are immutable, a new object is created and is
propagated to all the instances of the class. However, if you change the
value of `var` in one of the instances, this will not hold anymore:

```python
my_class.var += 1
print(id(my_class.var))
# 10935552
print(id(my_class_2.var))
# 10935520
print(id(MyClass.var))
# 10935520
```

You can see that both the attributes in `MyClass` and in `my_class_2`
are still the same object, while the identity of `var` in `my_class`
changed. From now on, any changes that you do to `MyClass.var` are
decoupled from the changes in `my_class`, but will still be reflected on
`my_class_2`.

Keeping in mind the differences between methods' default values and
class attributes open a lot of possibilities when designing a program.
The fact that you can alter all objects from within a specific instance
can be of great use when properties change at runtime. Even if not an
extremely common scenario for short-lived scripts, it is very common
when dealing with user interaction on programs that run for hours or
days.
