---

If you have ever followed a guide on how to start programming, most
likely you have encounter reflections about the importance of adding
comments to your code. Comments allow you to understand what the
developer was thinking when programming, maybe left some traces of what
could be improved. If you are developing software in places where people
change often, it is crucial to leave extra information behind, to speed
up the catching up of the new developers.

Python has a very robust system for documenting functions, classes and
variables. It is so robust that allows you to check for help in the
interactive console, it can be used for testing your code and can be
converted into beautifully formatted HTML or PDF documentation. In this
tutorial, you will see how to write documentation for your projects and
how to host it for free on [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

Building a Simple Module
========================

To start with this tutorial, we will need to build a simple module, with
some classes and functions. My recommendation is to work inside a
[Virtual Environment](%7Bfilename%7D03_Virtual_Environment.rst). Start
by creating a folder to hold your project. Inside create a new folder
called my\_module and add an empty **\_\_init\_\_.py** file. Create a
file called **factorial.py** and add the following code:

```python
import math

def factorial(n):
    if not n >= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be >= 0")
    if math.floor(n) != n:
        raise ValueError("n must be exact integer")
    if n + 1 == n:  # catch a value like 1e300
        raise OverflowError("n too large")
    result = 1
    factor = 2
    while factor <= n:
        result *= factor
        factor += 1
    return result
```

You can find the files [in tag
0.1](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/0.1/example_code/11_documenting/my_module)
on GitHub. If you would like to use the code, you can do the following:

```pycon
>>> from my_module.factorial import factorial
>>> factorial(5)
120
```

And you can also use the help, like this:

```pycon
>>> help(factorial)
Help on function factorial in module my_module.factorial:

factorial(n)
```

Which is not very descriptive, but we will get to it.

Adding Docstrings
=================

When you use the command `help`, Python will look for a string right
after the definition of the function. In the case of `factorial` there
we no string, so let's add one and see how it works. I will remove the
extra code for brevity and will replace it by `[...]`.

```python
def factorial(n):
    'Function to calculate the factorial'
[...]
```

Remember that if you make changes to a module in Python, you have to
quit and import it again. If you just reimport a module, you won't see
the latest changes. And now you will see the following:

```python
>>> help(factorial)
factorial(n)
    Function to calculate the factorial
```

The string that is being printed is the same that you wrote right after
the definition of your function. Traditionally in Python, docstrings are
defined using three `''`, which will allow you to span the documentation
into several lines as well. For example:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Function to calculate the factorial.
    For example:

    >>> factorial(5)
    120
    """
    [...]
```

The example above is showing you that you can extend the documentation
of a function also with examples. Next time you use `help`, you will see
a more complete explanation of what the function does and how to use it.
If you are familiar with numpy, for example, you should try to run help
on any of its modules. You will notice the level of detail that they
accomplish in their documentation.

Of course, you are not limited to documenting functions. You can
document the entire module by adding a string right at the top of the
file.

```python
"""
Module factorial
================
This module supplies one function, factorial() to calculate the factorial of an integer.
"""
import math
[...]
```

If instead of importing the function, you import the module, you can
see:

```pycon
>>> from my_module import factorial
>>> help(factorial)
Help on module factorial:

NAME
    factorial

DESCRIPTION
    Module factorial
    ================
    This module supplies one function, factorial() to calculate the factorial of an integer.

FUNCTIONS
    factorial(n)
        Function to calculate the factorial of a number.
        For example:

        >>> factorial(5)
        120
```

As you can see, docstrings are very useful when you are trying to
navigate a package full of modules. You can quickly understand if the
module factorial is what you are looking for or not. It doesn't matter
if you are reading the code itself or if you are working from the
command line, the docstrings are a great way of communicating with other
developers (and even with your future self).

The code up to here can be found in [Tag
0.3](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/0.3/example_code/11_documenting/my_module).

From docstrings to doctest
==========================

A very useful approach when developing code is to test it. Especially if
you are going to collaborate with others. Testing means to run the code
with inputs to which you know the expected outcome. If the output is
correct, the test passes, if the output is not correct, the test fails.
This is a very systematic way to be sure that modifications to existing
code are not going to ruin code downstream, for example.

Building tests is no simple task because you have to be sure of what you
want to test. Docstrings allow you an easy path to testing through the
examples that you provide. If you pay attention to the code above, you
can see that we have already provided an example of how to use the code
and the expected output. You can instruct Python to look for these
examples and check if the output matches.

```bash
python -m doctest -v factorial.py
```

And you will see that the output actually says that it is trying to
execute `factorial(5)` and that it is expecting the output to be `120`.
This is great because if you are trying to improve the code, you have to
be sure that at least when you use the number 5 it works correctly.
Another possible behavior is to check that if you are outside of the
limits, and an error is raised. You don't want to calculate the
factorial of `-1`, for instance. We can add a new example to the
docstring:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """ [...]
    >>> factorial(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: n must be >= 0
    """
```

If you test your code again, you will see that this time there are two
tests that pass. This article is not really on testing, but it was
important to point out that docstrings are a very easy way to testing,
at least the basic functionality of your packages. You can also add
examples at a module level, not only at a function level.

Documenting classes and methods
===============================

When you work with classes and methods, the docstrings work in exactly
the same way. Let's create a new file called **people.py** with two
classes and some methods:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, course):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.course = course

    def get_course(self):
        return self.course

    def set_course(self, new_course):
        self.course = new_course
```

As an exercise, you can write the docstrings for each class and method,
or you can go directly to [Tag
0.5](https://github.com/PFTL/website/blob/0.5/example_code/11_documenting/my_module/people.py)
and grab the example from there. There is something very important to
note and is that classes should document all the methods, also the
`__init__` and the class itself. If you use the `help` command, you will
see the following:

```pycon
>>> from people import Person
>>> help(Person)
class Person(builtins.object)
 |  Class to store a general person information. For example the name.
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(self, name)
 |      Create a person object by providing a name
```

It is important to note that you can get the help not only of the class
but also of an instance of that class. For example, you can generate the
same output if you do:

```pycon
>>> me = Person('My Self')
>>> help(me)
```

Moreover, you can access the docstring directly, as an attribute of the
class, and you can modify it:

```pycon
>>> Person.__doc__
'Class to store a general person information. For example the name.'
```

Building Documentation with Sphinx
==================================

Now you have developed a package with several modules, each with its own
docstring. However, this can be even better. You can compile all the
docstrings of your modules into a single place, a website or a pdf, that
will make it very easy to share the information, look for help and
provide examples that extend what is appropriate for a docstring. To
achieve all this, you need to install a package called *Sphinx*:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

Sphinx can convert a special format of files, called *RestructuredText*
into other handy formats, such as html, pdf, etc. After you have
installed sphinx, the quickest is to run `sphinx-quickstart` which will
guide you through some questions in order to create the needed folders,
the base **config.py** file and a starting point. You are free to try it
out. I am going to take the slightly longer path, covering the details
of what you should do.

First, create a folder called **docs**, next to the folder
**my\_module**. This will allow you to separate the development of code
from the development of the code itself. If you are using version
control, this can make your life much easier. Inside the **docs**,
create a folder **source** and place a file called **config.py**, with
the following:

```python
project = 'My Module'
copyright = '2018, Aquiles Carattino'
author = 'Aquiles Carattino'
version = ''
release = '0.1'
templates_path = ['_templates']
source_suffix = '.rst'
master_doc = 'index'
pygments_style = 'sphinx'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
html_static_path = ['_static']
```

This file specifies some general properties of the project, such as the
version, the release, the author, etc. And some options that are
important for building the documentation, such as the default source
suffix, i.e. which files are going to be parsed. The [configuration
help](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html) has
all the information that you need to customize the build. Create a new
file, called *index.rst* and add the following:

```rst
Welcome to My Module's documentation!
=====================================
This is going to become the future documentation of My Project

.. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2
     :caption: Contents:
```

Next, just run the following command from the **docs** folder:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html source/ build/
```

If you check now the **build** folder, you will see that several files
were generated. Open **index.html** and you will find a page that looks
like the following:

![screenshot of the documentation](/images/10_images/01_base_page.png){.center-img}

Adding the documentation of your modules
----------------------------------------

One of the advantages of Sphinx is that it can automatically build the
documentation for your modules. Let's see how to do it. Next to the file
index.rst create a new file called **people.rst** and add the following:

```rst
.. automodule:: my_module.people
    :members:
```

You will need to update the file **config.py** in order to instruct
sphinx to build the documentation for your modules. Add the following:

```python
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))
extensions = [
'sphinx.ext.autodoc',]
```

The first few lines are needed in order to tell Sphinx where your
package is. In this case, since you start in the *source* folder, it is
two levels up. Then, you need to add an extension, that will allow you
to build the documentation for modules. Run again the command:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html source/ build/
```

You should see a warning message stating:

```bash
[...] people.rst: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```

Don't worry about it now. It is just telling you that there are no links
to the file, and therefore someone who is browsing through your
documents will not be able to reach that file. If you look again at the
folder *build* you will see a new file called **people.html**. Open it,
and you should see the following:

![screenshot of the documentation of a module](/images/10_images/02_base_module.png){.center-img}

Which is a great starting point for the documentation of your project!
You see the code nice highlighted. You should see that the first part of
the page corresponds to the docstring of the module, this is the first
string that you defined at the beginning of the file. The rest is
grabbing each of the classes that you have defined within that module.

Now we can add the documentation for **factorial**, creating a new file
called **factorial.rst** next to **index.rst** and **people.rst**. Add
the following content:

```rst
.. automodule:: my_module.factorial
    :members:
```

And now it is time to link to these files from **index.rst** in order to
be able to navigate through the documentation. Add the following:

```rst
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :caption: Contents:

    factorial
    people
```

Build again the documentation and now you should see that there are no
more warnings. Moreover, if you open **index.html** you will see the
links to the two pages. You can find all the code at [Tag
0.6](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/0.6/example_code/11_documenting/docs/source)
on Github.

Customizing the pages
---------------------

So far you have used the `automodule` command, together with the option
`:members:`, but you are not obliged to do that. You can build the
documentation for specific elements, and you can add more information
than the provided in the docstrings. Let's update the **factorial.rst**
file. Add the following:

```rst
How to calculate the factorial
==============================
The factorial is a mathematical operation that calculates the product of all the numbers up to the specified integer.

For example, the factorial of 5 would be 1*2*3*4*5 = 120. With our code we can do the following::

    >>> factorial(5)
    120

.. automodule:: my_module.factorial

The function Factorial
======================
The function factorial is also well documented.

.. autofunction:: my_module.factorial.factorial
```

If you build again the documentation, you will see that the output has
changed a lot. First, the title of the page is *How to calculate the
factorial* and now you have some structure in the *Table Of Contents*.
You will see these changes also if you check the *index.html* file.
Restructured text is very complex, and it is not our scope to cover it
all. What you should know, at least, is that to make titles you have to
underline them with `=`. Subtitles, i.e. second order titles, are
underlined with `-` and so forth. You can check the [Quick Reference to
Restructured
Text](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) if
you want to learn more.

If you want to include code, you have two options.

```rst
This is an example::

    >>> factorial(5)
    120

But this also works:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> factorial(5)
    120

The indenting is important to establish beginning and ending of blocks.
```

Now you see that the complexity of the documentation is growing. You can
add examples, extra information, math formulas. You are actually
building a complete website, just that a part of it is automatically
created from code. If you are curious, this website is built using a
similar approach, you can check the code of the articles in [the website
repository](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/master/content).

Styling the Docstrings
======================

So far we have added some simple information in the docstrings, but this
is not all that you can do. For example, the **factorial** function
takes as arguments integers and returns integers. This can also be
specified in the docstring, making it very easy to track possible
errors. When you want to go to this extent of detail, you will see that
different packages use different styles, i.e., you specify inputs and
outputs in different ways. We are going to follow the **reST** style,
which is automatically supported by Sphinx and editors such as Pycharm.

Edit **factorial.py** with the following:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    [...]
    :param n: Number to calculate the factorial
    :type n: int
    :return: The calculated factorial
    :rtype: int
     """
```

First, you explain what the parameter is, in this case, the input **n**.
You can also explicitly tell the type of the input. If the function
returns something, you can explain what it returns and the type of the
return. In this case, it is again an integer. If you build the
documentation again, you will see that this information is automatically
added to the page **factorial.html**.

Some other possible styles are [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/),
which relies on its own generator, instead of Sphinx,
[reST](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which we used above,
[Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments)
has its own style, and finally, you can also use the [Numpy
Style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You have to find the
one you feel more comfortable with. In the end, they all provide the
same functionality.

Linking to other modules
------------------------

When you are documenting your programs, you will notice that you will
need to refer to some other pieces of code that you have written. In our
example, `Teacher` subclasses `Person`, and therefore it can be handy to
add a link to it in the docstring. You can edit **people.py** with the
following:

```python
class Teacher(Person):
    """Class to store a teacher's information. It subclasses :class:`Person`."""
    [...]
```

Note the addition of
`` :class:`Person ``. If you build the documentation again, you will see that that code turns into a link the appropriate file. If you check Tag
0.7
&lt;<https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/0.7/example_code/11_documenting/docs/source>&gt;\_ you will see that it works even if you split the documentation into different files. For example, we have created a new page for the teacher documentation, but the link still points to where the class Person\`
is defined.

Running tests with Sphinx
=========================

We have seen before that you can use the docstrings to run tests in your
code. You can think about them as testing your code or testing whether
your documentation is up to date. In any case, it would be very handy if
sphinx could run the `doctest` while building the documentation. In this
way, you can check all your files, instead of testing one by one.

The first step is to update your **conf.py** file by adding the doctest
extension:

```python
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.doctest',]
```

And now you can trigger sphinx with another parameter:

```bash
sphinx-build -b doctest source/ output/
```

This will generate a new file called **output.txt** with the same
information that was printed to screen. Most likely you will see that
some fails appear, and if you look closely you will see that the problem
is that, for example, `NameError: name 'factorial' is not defined`. This
happens because doctest is trying to run the example code without
importing the appropriate modules. The easiest solution is to explicitly
import the function you need. For example, `factorial` will look like
this:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Function to calculate the factorial of a number.
    First import, and then use, for example:

    >>> from my_module.factorial import factorial
    >>> factorial(5)
    120
    >>> factorial(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: n must be >= 0

    :param n: Number to calculate the factorial
    :type n: int
    :return: The calculated factorial
    :rtype: int
    """
```

You can also add the import statement to the docstring of the module,
and with this, you know that you will have it available in the rest of
the code. You can see, for example, the code at [Tag
0.8](https://github.com/PFTL/website/tree/0.8/example_code/11_documenting).
Running doctests is a great way of improving the quality of your
documentation and of your code without too much effort. Moreover, you
also give people the possibility to check that everything is behaving
correctly before sending your suggestions for code changes (pull
requests on Github).

Read The Docs
=============

Now you have learned how to build the documentation on your local
machine. Anybody with your code and Sphinx installed can run the same
commands and build the HTML files. However, being able to host them
somewhere will make it very handy for people who would like to see and
learn from your code. It will also be indexed by search engines,
effectively increasing your online visibility. If you look around, all
big projects have their documentation hosted online.

If you want to host the documentation on your own web server, you can do
it easily. However, this adds not only money for the web server, but
also effort, since you need to maintain the pages updated every time
there is a change to the documentation. This is when Read The Docs comes
into play. It is a service that automatically builds the documentation
of your projects and hosts it open to the public.

The only requirement for Read the Docs to work is that you have your
code in a repository such as Github, GitLab or Bitbucket. I won't cover
the details of those repositories here, I will assume you know how to
work with them.

Go to [Read The Docs (RTL)](https://readthedocs.org) and create an
account. Follow the steps and activate your e-mail. Once you have logged
in, go to your settings:

![Read the docs settings](/images/10_images/RTL_settings.png){.center-img}

And then you have to select the services you want to connect to your
account:

![Connecting services to RTL](/images/10_images/RTL_settings.png){.center-img}

If for some reason you cannot connect the service that you want, you can
manually import the repository. Just go to **My Projects** and select
the option that says **Import Manually**. Once you have imported your
project, you have to configure how do you want your documentation to be
built. You have to open the project and go the\**Admin*\* panel. Select
**Advanced Settings**.

![Connecting services to RTL](/images/10_images/RTL_advance_settings.png){.center-img}

You will see that the platform allows you to install the package inside
a Virtual Environment. This is very important and is something we
haven't discussed yet. When you build the documentation with Sphinx,
what is actually happening is that the program imports all the modules
and checks for the docstrings. For this to work, Sphinx needs to be able
to import the module. Let's say that you use numpy, which is not
installed by default with Python. If you import a module that depends on
numpy but it is not installed, the import process will fail.

If you have a file that lists all the packages that have to be installed
for your program to work, Read The Docs can automatically install them
in a virtual environment and then build the documentation. That is what
the **requirements.txt** file is for. You can see how to generate one by
reading [our article on the Virtual
Environment](%7Bfilename%7D03_Virtual_Environment.rst). The other
important parameter is the location of the **conf.py** file. Normally
you would place it in **docs/source/conf.py**, but that can change from
project to project. You can go through the rest of the options. Remember
to set the proper Python version that you need for your program to run.

![Connecting services to RTL](/images/10_images/RTL_advanced_settings.png){.center-img}

If you go to the **Versions** option, you will be able to select for
which version to build the documentation. For example, you can build
documentation only for a specific branch, or for a specific version. In
this way you won't risk users reading documentation is not supposed to
be online yet but that is work in progress. Remember that if there is a
mismatch between the documentation and the code, a lot of questions are
going to arise.

![Connecting services to RTL](/images/10_images/RTL_versions.png){.center-img}

That is basically it. You can trigger a build of your documentation and
see what happens. You can see the history of builds and their results.
If you click on any of them, you will see all the commands that were
executed and their outcome, if any. Including any errors. If the build
passes, you can click the green button that says **View Docs**. Now you
have a beautiful, online version of the documentation of your program.

Read the Docs even allows you to add the code of Google analytics to
track how many visitors your project has. However, when you start
building up in complexity, it is also harder for Read the Docs to work
out of the box. Special packages, which cannot be installed with `pip`
need special handling, which we may cover in a future article.

If you want the documentation to automatically build when there is an
update in the repository, you need to add a *webhook*. Head over to the
Admin of your project and select **Integrations** which will allow you
to set up a webhook. If you have any doubt, [webhooks are very well
documented](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks.html) in Read
The Docs. The core idea is that any time there is a change in a
repository, it will use the webhook to let different services know about
the update, and that will trigger, for example, a new built of the
documentation.

Conclusions
===========

Documenting your code is fundamental if you want your programs to be
sustainable over time. Adding comments where appropriate is the first
step any good programmer should take. Adding docstrings to modules,
functions, and classes is the first step. If you add Sphinx to the mix,
you can start building beautiful documentation in the form of websites,
for example. Moreover, you can host the website with Read The Docs,
which will automatically build the documentation for you.

Having the documentation as a website is a great way of attracting
attention. It will be indexed by search engines, making it more
discoverable. You can also supply examples, images, whatever you think
that can be useful. I really appreciate when the documentation guides
you quickly through the installation process and some examples. Just for
you to get started.
