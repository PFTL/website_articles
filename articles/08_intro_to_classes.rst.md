Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Object-oriented
programming is a programming design that allows developers not only to
define the type of data of a variable but also the operations that can
act on that data. For example, a variable can be of type integer, float,
string, etc. We know that we can multiply an integer to another, or
divide a float by another, but that we cannot add an integer to a
string. Objects allow programmers to define operations both between
different objects as with themselves. For example, we can define an
object `person`, add a birthday and have a function that returns the
person's age.

At the beginning it will not be clear why objects are useful, but over
time it becomes impossible not to think with objects in mind. Python
takes the objects ideas one step further, and considers every variable
an object. Even if you didn't realize, it is possible that you have
already encountered some of these ideas when working with numpy arrays,
for example. In this chapter we are going to cover from the very basics
of object design to slightly more advanced topics in which we can define
a custom behavior for most of the common operations.

Defining a Class
================

Let's dive straight into how to work with classes in Python. Defining a
class is as simple as doing:

```python
class Person:
    pass
```

When speaking it is very hard not to interchange the words `Class` and
`Object`. The reality is that the difference between them is very
subtle: an object is an instance of a class. This means that we will use
the word *classes* when referring to the type of variable, while we will
use *object* to the variable itself. It is going to become clearer later
on.

In the example above, we've defined a class called `Person` that doesn't
do anything, that is why it says `pass`. We can add more functionality
to this class by declaring a function that belongs to it. Create a file
called **person.py** and add the following code to it:

```python
class Person:
    def echo_name(self, name):
        return name
```

In Python, the functions that belong to classes are called **methods**.
For using the class, we have to create a variable of type person. Back
in the Python Interactive Console, you can, for example, do:

```pycon
>>> from person import Person
>>> me = Person()
>>> me.echo_name("John Snow")
John Snow
```

The first line imports the code into the interactive console. For this
to work, it is important that you trigger python directly from the same
folder where the file **person.py** is located. When you run the code
above, you should see as output `John Snow`. There is also an important
detail that was omitted this far, the presence of `self` in the
declaration of the method. All the methods in python take a first input
variable called self, referring to the class itself. For the time being
don't stress yourself about it, but bear in mind that when you define a
new method, you should always include the `self`, but when calling the
method you should never include it. You can also write methods that
don't take any input, but still will have the `self` in them, for
example:

```python
def echo_True(self):
    return "True"
```

that can be used by doing:

```pycon
>>> me.echo_True()
```

So far, defining a function within a class has no advantage at all. The
main difference, and the point where methods become handy is because
they have access to all the information stored within the object itself.
The `self` argument that we are passing as first argument of the
function is exactly that. For example, we can add the following two
methods to our class Person:

```python
def store_name(self, name):
    self.stored_name = name

def get_name(self):
    return self.stored_name
```

And then we can execute this:

```pycon
>>> me = Person()
>>> me.store_name('John Snow')
>>> print(me.get_name())
John Snow
>>> print(me.stored_name)
John Snow
```

What you can see in this example is that the method `store_name` takes
one argument, `name` and stores it into the class variable
`stored_name`. Variables in the context of classes are called
**attributes** in the context of a class. The method `get_name` just
returns the stored property. What we showed in the last line is that we
can access the property directly, without the need to call the
`get_name` method. In the same way, we don't need to use the
`store_name` method if we do:

```pycon
>>> me.stored_name = 'Jane Doe'
>>> print(me.get_name())
Jane Doe
```

One of the advantages of the attributes of classes is that they can be
of any type, even other classes. Imagine that you have acquired a time
trace of an analog sensor and you have also recorded the temperature of
the room when the measurement started. You can easily store that
information in an object:

```python
measurement.temperature = '20 degrees'
measurement.timetrace = np.array([...])
```

What you have so far is a vague idea of how classes behave, and maybe
you are starting to imagine some places where you can use a class to
make your daily life easier and your code more reusable. However, this
is just the tip of the iceberg. Classes are very powerful tools.

Initializing classes
====================

**Instantiating** a class is the moment in which we call the class and
pass it to a variable. In the previous example, the instantiation of the
class happened at the line reading `me = Person()`. You may have noticed
that the property `stored_name` does not exist in the object until we
assign a value to it. This can give very serious headaches if someone
calls the method `get_name` before actually having a name stored (you
can give it a try to see what happens!) Therefore it is very useful to
run a default method when the class is first called. This method is
called `__init__`, and you can use it like this:

```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self):
        self.stored_name = ""

    [...]
```

If you go ahead and run the `get_name` without actually storing a name
beforehand, now there will be no error, just an empty string being
returned. While initializing you can also force the execution of other
methods, for example:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.store_name('')

[...]
```

Will have the same final effect. It is however common (and smart)
practice, to declare all the variables of your class at the beginning,
inside your `__init__`. In this way you don't depend on specific methods
being called to create the variables.

As with any other method, you can have an `__init__` method with more
arguments than just `self`. For example you can define it like this:

```python
def __init__(self, name):
    self.stored_name = name
```

Now the way you instantiate the class is different, you will have to do
it like this:

```python
me = Person('John Snow')
print(me.get_name())
```

When you do this, your previous code will stop working, because now you
have to set the `name` explicitly. If there is any other code that does
`Person()`, it will fail. The proper way of altering the functioning of
a method is to add a default value in case no explicit value is passed.
The `__init__` would become:

```python
def __init__(self, name=''):
    self.stored_name = name
```

With this modification, if you don't explicitly specify a name when
instantiating the class, it will default to `''`, i.e., an empty string.

Defining default values for parameters in methods has to be handled with
care. They are very useful when you expect people to always use the same
values and only occasionally to change them. Trying to keep backwards
compatibility by declaring default values can make your code look
chaotic, so you have to do it only when it is worth doing, and not all
the time. When developing, it is impossible not to refactor code.

Defining class attributes
=========================

So far, if you wanted to have properties available right after the
instantiation of a class, you had to include them in the `__init__`
method. However, this is not the only possibility. You can define
attributes that belong to the class itself. Doing it is as simple as
declaring them before the `__init__` method. For example, we could do
this:

```python
class Person():
    birthday = '2010-10-10'
    def __init__(self, name=''):
        [...]
```

If you use the new `Person` class, you will have an attribute called
`birthday` available, but with some interesting behavior. First, let's
start as always:

```pycon
>>> from person import Person
>>> guy = Person('John Snow')
>>> print(guy.birthday)
2010-10-10
```

What you see above is that it doesn't matter if you define the birthday
within the `__init__` method or before, when you instantiate the class,
you access the property in the same way. The main difference is what
happens before instantiating the class:

```pycon
>>> from person import Person
>>> print(Person.birthday)
2010-10-10
>>> Person.birthday = '2011-11-11'
>>> new_guy = Person('Cersei Lannister')
>>> print(new_guy.birthday)
2011-11-11
```

What you see in the code above is that you can access class attributes
before you instantiate anything. That is why they are class and not
object attributes. Subtleties apart, once you change the class
attribute, in the example above, the birthday, next time you create an
object with that class, it will receive the new property. At the
beginning it is hard to understand why it is useful, but one day you
will need it and it will save you a lot of time.

Inheritance
===========

One of the advantages of working with classes in Python is that it
allows you to use the code from other developers and expand or change
its behavior without modifying the original code. The best idea is to
see it in action. So far we have a class called `Person`, which is
general but not too useful. Let's assume we want to define a new class,
called `Teacher`, that has the same properties as a `Person` (i.e., name
and birthday) plus it is able to teach a class. You can add the
following code to the file **person.py**:

```python
class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, course):
        self.course = course

    def get_course(self):
        return self.course

    def set_course(self, new_course):
        self.course = new_course
```

Note that in the definition of the new `Teacher` class, we have added
the `Person` class. In Python jargon, this means that the class
`Teacher` is a child of the class `Person`, or the opposite, that
`Person` is the parent of `Teacher`. This is called **inheritance** and
you will notice that a lot of different projects take advantage of it.
You can use the class `Teacher` in the same way as you have used the
class `Person`:

```pycon
>>> from person import Teacher
>>> me = Teacher('math')
>>> print(me.get_course)
math
>>> print(me.birthday)
2010-10-10
```

However, if you try to use the teacher's name it is going to fail:

```pycon
>>> print(me.get_name())
[...]
AttributeError: 'Teacher' object has no attribute 'stored_name'
```

The reason behind this error is that `get_name` returns `stored_name` in
the class Person. However, the property `stored_name` is created when
running the `__init__` method of Person, which didn't happen. You could
have changed the code above slightly to make it work:

```pycon
>>> from person import Teacher
>>> me = Teacher('math')
>>> me.store_name('J.J.R.T.')
>>> print(me.get_course)
math
>>> print(me.get_name())
J.J.R.T.
```

However, there is also another approach to avoid the error. You could
simply run the `__init__` method of the parent class (i.e. the base
class), you need to add the following:

```python
class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, course):
        super().__init__()
        self.course = course
    [...]
```

When you use `super()`, you are going to have access directly to the
class from which you are inheriting. In the example above, you
explicitly called the `__init__` method of the parent class. If you try
again to run the method `me.get_name()`, you will see that no error
appears, but also that nothing is printed to screen. This is because you
triggered the `super().__init__()` without any arguments and therefore
the name defaulted to the empty string. You could change the code like
this:

```python
class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, course):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.course = course
    [...]
```

which you would use combining both examples above:

```pycon
>>> from person import Teacher
>>> me = Teacher('John', 'math')
>>> print(me.get_name())
John
```

It is important to note that when importing the class, you only import
the one you want to use, you don't need to import the parent, that is
the responsibility of whoever developed the `Teacher` class.

Finer details of classes
========================

With what you have learned up to here, you can achieve a lot of things,
it is just a matter of thinking how to connect different methods when it
is useful to inherit. Without doubts, it will help you to understand the
code developed by others. There are, however, some details that are
worth mentioning, because you can improve how your classes look and
behave.

Printing objects
----------------

Let's see, for example, what happens if you print an object:

```pycon
>>> from person import Person
>>> guy = Person('John Snow')
>>> print(guy)
<__main__.Student object at 0x7f0fcd52c7b8>
```

The output of printing `guy` is quite ugly and is not particularly
useful. Fortunately, you can control what appears on the screen. You
have to update the `Person` class. Add the following method to the end:

```python
def __str__(self):
    return "Person class with name {}".format(self.stored_name)
```

If you run the code above, you will get the following:

```pycon
>>> print(guy)
Person class with name John Snow
```

You can get very creative. It is also important to point out that the
method `__str__` will be used also when you want to transform an object
into a string, for example like this:

```pycon
>>> class_str = str(guy)
>>> print(class_str)
Person class with name John Snow
```

Which also works if you do this:

```pycon
>>> print('My class is {}.'.format(guy))
```

Something that is important to point out is that this method is
inherited. Therefore, if you, instead of printing a `Person`, print a
`Student`, you will see the same output, which may or may not be the
desired behavior.

Defining complex properties
---------------------------

When you are developing complex classes, sometimes you would like to
alter the behavior of assigning values to an attribute. For example you
would like to change the age of a person when you store the year of
birth:

```pycon
>>> person.year_of_birth = 1980
>>> print(person.age)
38
```

There is a way of doing this in Python which can be easily implemented
even if you don't fully understand the syntax. Working again in the
class `Person`, we can do the following:

```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        self.stored_name = name
        self._year_of_birth = 0
        self.age = 0

    @property
    def year_of_birth(self):
        return self._year_of_birth

    @year_of_birth.setter
    def year_of_birth(self, year)
        self.age = 2018 - year
        self._year_of_birth = year
```

Which can be used like this:

```pycon
>>> from people import Person
>>> me = Person('Me')
>>> me.age
0
>>> me.year_of_birth = 1980
>>> me.age
32
```

What is happening is that Python gives you control over everything,
including what does the `=` do when you assign a value to an attribute
of a class. The first time you create a `@property`, you need to specify
a function that returns a value. In the case above, we are returning
`self._year_of_birth`. Just doing that will allow you to use
`me.year_of_birth` as an attribute, but it will fail if you try to
change its value. This is called a read-only property. If you are
working in the lab, it is useful to define methods as read-only
properties when you can't change the value. For example, a method for
reading the serial number of a device would be read-only.

If you want to change the value of a property, you have to define a new
method. This method is going to be called a *setter*. That is why you
can see the line `@year_of_birth.setter`. The method takes an argument
that triggers two actions. On the one hand, it updates the age, on the
other it stores the year in an attribute. It takes a while to get used
to, but it can be very handy.

Conclusions
===========

This article is a very short primer on how to start working with classes
in Python. You are not supposed to be an expert after such a brief
walk-through, but it should be enough for getting you started with your
own developments, and, more importantly, to be able to read other
developers code and understand what they are doing.

The series of primer articles are thought as a go-to destination when
you need to refresh a specific concept. If you find anything missing,
